# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: 'echo "$(Build.DefinitionName), $(Build.BuildId), $(Build.BuildNumber)" > buildinfo.txt'
  displayName: 'Print build info'
  workingDirectory: test1/basw
